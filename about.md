Catz Computer Science Society (CCSS) is a society for students of St Catherine's
College, Oxford which is focused on computer science and related miscellanea.

It's a new society, so we haven't done anything yet, but there are grand plans…

It's also currently a one-man-show. My name is Nick Hu, and I'm a second year
undergraduate Computer Science student at Catz. I founded this society for a few
reasons:

* There are tonnes of fascinating things inside CS but not in the syllabus
* Lots of students who don't study CS have no avenue to pursue an interest in it
    + Peoples' eyes tend to glaze over when I try to explain my degree to them:
    + *"It's like maths and logic but there are practical applications too."*
* CS students in different years don't talk to each other, which seems like such
  a wasted opportunity
* CS students will be expected to give presentations and write technical
  documentation regardless of what they choose to pursue as a career
    + By establishing a platform for casual semi-academic talks and publication,
      I hope to give them a way to hone these skills - akin to student
      journalism, but for programmers/tech nerds
* I think at a scale smaller than the University-wide CompSoc, we can pursue
  tighter goals and host more intimate events
* We have some really cool CS tutors at Catz, who have plenty of interesting
  things to talk about - I'd like to give them a way to do this so that they can
  give a casual presentation about something they find interesting in CS
  (perhaps related to their research) without having to structure an entire
  lecture course and assignments around it

Here are some of the things I plan to do^[But I'm open to suggestions!]:

* Lightning talks
    + 20/30 minute talks about a topic related to Computer Science (even
    tangentially). Could range wildly from things like Category theory to
    stack-smashing buffer overflow exploitation to full stack development with
    React.js. It's really up to whoever wants to give a talk and what topic they
    want to talk about. There's no reason why we should restrict speakers to CS
    students, and definitely no reason to impose any audience restrictions. How
    do we make a talk given by a first year interesting to someone in fourth
    year? Simply, we don't - I'll publish a list of upcoming talks and timeslots
    well in advance and people can pick and choose whatever they want to attend.
    I want talks to come with *zero warranty*, so that people shouldn't feel too
    anxious about giving a talk or that giving a talk is unapproachable. It's
    really about governing a community around a common interest and giving people
    an opportunity to share something exciting and practice their presenting
    skills, rather than making the next ground-breaking discovery^[No
    guarantees that this won't happen]. At the moment, I'm thinking of doing two
    sessions in Michaelmas: 2nd week, and 6th week^[This may be subject to
    change].
* Magazine
    + Following on from the above, it could be cool if we could collate together
    some of the stuff we talk about together in a magazine-like format (kind of
    like somewhere between a blog entry and a technical article). See the [Monad
    Reader](https://themonadreader.wordpress.com/) for an example of the format
    I'm trying to go for. Assuming the talks are a success, and I do a couple
    each term, I think I could put together an issue on a termly basis.
* Socials
    + It would be nice to just get together and go to the pub or go for a meal.
      I've heard in times-gone-by that this used to happen on a semi-regular
      basis; let's revive it.
* Programming competitions
    + Lots of students are extremely interested in programming, and many
      (particularly from abroad) have participated in programming competitions.
      It would be nice to run some in college, and give out gag gifts etc. I'm not
      an expert on this, but let's see how it goes…
    + I've got an avid interest in security, and have always wanted to run a CTF…

Hopefully, I'll have great success (fingers crossed).

It's also definitely not going to be easy to do this myself, so **I am looking for
help**.
